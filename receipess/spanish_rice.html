        <h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
        <p>My family loves various ethnic foods, but this traditional Spanish rice is one of their favorites. My niece, of Spanish descent, lives with us and has tweaked my old Spanish rice recipe to make it just like her grandma's. My mother-in-law has also added this recipe to her school meals menu (minus the jalapeño), and it is a hit with the students and faculty.</p>
